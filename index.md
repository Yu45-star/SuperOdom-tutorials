# SuperOdom Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive SuperOdom tutorial! 

SuperOdom is an IMU-centric, real-time LiDAR-visual-inertial estimator that maintains centimetre-level accuracy in harsh, perceptually degraded environments by opportunistically fusing vision and LiDAR through a fast dynamic-octree map.


## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](/tutorials/installation/)
- [Quick Start](/tutorials/quickstart/)
- [API Reference](/api/)

## Key Features

- IMU-centric backbone (1 kHz)
- Three asynchronous sub-graphs
- Dynamic, hashed octree map
- Multi-metric ICP residuals
- Automatic sensor-quality weighting
- Real-time, centimetre accuracy
- Field-proven robustness
